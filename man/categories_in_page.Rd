categories for.}

\item{properties}{The properties you want to retrieve about the categories.

\item{limit}{The maximum number of categories you want to retrieve for each page. Set
to 50 by default.}

\item{show_hidden}{Whether or not to include 'hidden' categories in the categories
that are retrieved - these are usually associated with the maintenance of Wikipedia
